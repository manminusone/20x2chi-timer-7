# Arduino admin controller

This directory contains Arduino sketches that can be used for running an admin interface for the timer. As of right now I am recommending using [M5Stack](http://www.m5stack.com/) Core or Core2 boards, since they are ideal self-contained general-purpose Arduino-compatible boards. See the appropriate Arduino sketch directory for more instructions.
